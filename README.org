* Practice your English `vocabulaire`!
A family member recently asked me if I could build her some software to practice english vocabulary. The application would rely on a CSV list of english to french translations to ask the player a french translation of a random expression.

I found this a good opportunity to have another go at Elm, especially since the latest 0.18 release. I'm happy to say it was again a fun experience!

The game can be played [[http://s3.amazonaws.com/translateme/index.html][here]].
